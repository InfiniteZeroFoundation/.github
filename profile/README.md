# InfiniteZero Foundation  
*Building **AI infrastructure for public goods**, owned and governed by the community* 🌍

**InfiniteZero Foundation** is a non-profit committed to creating **trustless, privacy-preserving AI infrastructure** for public goods, operating with a **minimal network fee**. Our mission is to empower **applications** and **communities** to participate in **AI-driven economies**, advancing **decentralized technologies built on Ethereum** 🔷 for the benefit of society and the planet.

At the core of **InfiniteZero** is **decentralization**, **community governance**, and **affordability**. The **InfiniteZero Network** operates without central ownership, ensuring power remains with the **community**. It is **trustless** by design, using **open-source protocols** and **Ethereum smart contracts** 🔷 to eliminate reliance on centralized control.

**InfiniteZero** runs on **Layer 2 networks built on Ethereum**, boosting performance while keeping control with users. By offloading computation to the **edge**, **Layer 2** ensures decentralization and integrity.

As an **open-source AI commons**, **InfiniteZero** enables **users** and **applications** to access decentralized AI models, improving services and driving innovation in a fully decentralized ecosystem.

Together, we’re building a future where AI is **owned and governed by the people** who use it.

## Real-World Use Cases 🌱

### Open-Platform Fitness Wearable Ecosystem

Open-platform fitness wearable ecosystems (e.g., ReflexDAO) can use the InfiniteZero Network to train **open-source AI models** directly on-local compute using user-consented biometric signals such as sleep patterns, movement, heart rate variability, and recovery metrics — without raw data ever leaving the device.

The network aggregates encrypted model updates to improve shared, open-source AI models that deliver actionable, educational insights for daily health optimization, recovery, and long-term wellness. **Training these open models is funded solely through an ETH-denominated network fee**, a portion of which is routed directly to the application owner, incentivizing open experimentation and increasing the overall utility of the ecosystem.

For **proprietary or premium models**, users can explicitly opt in to have their data used to **fine-tune specific models** under clearly defined terms. In these cases, **data owners are compensated in USDT stablecoins** for contributing to model training, while applications continue to benefit from network participation and fee sharing. This approach preserves privacy and user control while enabling high-quality, model-specific improvements on top of the shared infrastructure.

*InfiniteZero uses lightweight, edge-optimized models, enabling training and inference on basic CPUs — including older laptops, mid-range smartphones, and Raspberry Pi–class devices. No large-scale GPU infrastructure or high-performance centralized hardware required.*
