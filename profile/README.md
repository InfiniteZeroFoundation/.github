## 💡 The Idea

The world's best AI is trained on humanity's collective knowledge, behaviour, and experience.
But it's built behind closed doors, by a handful of companies, for profit.

**What if we built it together instead?**

InfiniteZero is open infrastructure for training AI as a public good — the way the internet itself is a public good. Millions of devices, millions of people, contributing quietly to something that benefits everyone.

No one company controls it. No one company profits from it. It just gets better, for everyone, together.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

Your device — your phone, your laptop — contributes to training shared AI models as you go about your day. Your raw data never leaves your hands. Only anonymised, encrypted patterns are shared with the network.

```
Your device learns locally  →  Encrypted patterns join the network  →  Shared AI models improve for everyone
```

The result is AI infrastructure that grows smarter the more people use it — like a library that gets better every time someone reads from it.

## 🌍 What Becomes Possible

When AI is trained collectively, in the open, it stops being a product and starts being infrastructure.

| Domain | What changes |
|---|---|
| 🏥 Health | A model trained across millions of people worldwide — not just those who can pay for premium care |
| 🌱 Agriculture | AI that learns from farmers across every climate and continent |
| 📚 Education | Tools that improve from the experience of students everywhere, not just in well-funded schools |

*This is what AI looks like when it's built* for *humanity rather than* about *it.*

## 🔧 For Developers

InfiniteZero gives you access to a **living, global AI commons** — where every model you deploy improves itself through millions of users, quietly and securely.

### 1️⃣ Model Trainers
You bring the brains. InfiniteZero brings the network.

- Deploy your AI models to the protocol.  
- Users’ devices train them locally on real-world data.  
- Receive anonymized, encrypted updates that make your model smarter — without touching raw user data.  
- Your work improves the AI for everyone, everywhere.

### 2️⃣ Application Developers
You bring the utility. The network brings the scale.

- Build apps that connect your users to the AI commons.  
- Users benefit automatically — smarter recommendations, better predictions, personalized insights.  
- Every interaction feeds back to the shared models, so your app **grows smarter with the global network**, without users ever seeing the protocol.

### ⚡ Why This Matters

| Traditional AI | InfiniteZero |
|---|---|
| You build your own dataset | The network provides millions of real-world contributions |
| AI improves your product only | AI improves every app, every user, every model |
| You manage raw user data | Data stays on devices; privacy is guaranteed |

## 💻 For Users

When you use an app built on InfiniteZero, your everyday activity — movement, choices, patterns — quietly helps train AI that belongs to everyone.

Your data never leaves your device. You're not a product. You're a contributor to something shared.

*Think of it less like using a service, and more like leaving a book better than you found it.*

## 🔷 Built on Ethereum

InfiniteZero runs on Ethereum — open, decentralised, with no central authority.
The network is secured by validators. The protocol is governed by the community.
The models it trains belong to the commons.
