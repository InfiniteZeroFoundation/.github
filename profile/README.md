## The Idea

The world's best AI is trained on humanity's collective knowledge, behaviour, and experience.
But it's built behind closed doors, by a handful of companies, for profit.

What if we built it together instead?

InfiniteZero is open infrastructure for training AI as a public good — the way Wikipedia is a public good, the way the internet itself is a public good. Millions of devices, millions of people, contributing quietly to something that benefits everyone.

No one company controls it. No one company profits from it. It just gets better, for everyone, together.

## How It Works

Your device — your phone, your laptop — contributes to training shared AI models as you go about your day. Your raw data never leaves your hands. Only anonymised, encrypted patterns are shared with the network.

```
Your device learns locally  →  Encrypted patterns join the network  →  Shared AI models improve for everyone
```

The result is AI infrastructure that grows smarter the more people use it — like a library that gets better every time someone reads from it.

## What Becomes Possible

When AI is trained collectively, in the open, it stops being a product and starts being infrastructure.

- A health model trained across millions of people worldwide, not just those who can pay for premium care
- An agricultural AI that learns from farmers across every climate and continent
- Education tools that improve from the experience of students everywhere, not just in well-funded schools

This is what AI looks like when it's built *for* humanity rather than *about* it.

## For Developers

InfiniteZero gives you access to continuously improving, community-trained AI models — without building or paying for the infrastructure yourself.

**Open-Source AI Commons**
Build on top of shared models trained by a global network of devices. Pay only a small network fee. Every app that builds on the commons also contributes back to it.

**Proprietary Enterprise Models**
Need something tailored? Build and fine-tune custom models on top of the commons, with users contributing under clear, consensual terms.

| Traditional AI development | Building on InfiniteZero |
|---|---|
| Build your own data pipeline | Tap into a growing global ecosystem |
| Store and secure raw user data | Training stays on user devices |
| Your AI improves your product only | Your work improves the commons too |

## For Users

When you use an app built on InfiniteZero, your everyday activity — movement, choices, patterns — quietly helps train AI that belongs to everyone.

Your data never leaves your device. You're not a product. You're a contributor to something shared.

Think of it less like using a service, and more like leaving a book better than you found it.

## Built on Ethereum

InfiniteZero runs on Ethereum — open, decentralised, with no central authority.
The network is secured by validators. The protocol is governed by the community.
The models it trains belong to the commons.
